        "## The Agent\n",
        "We now turn to the agent. An agent receives the current state and (previous) reward from the environment, then uses an internal policy to determine an action to take. We implement an agent as a Python [**class**](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Beginner%27s_Python_Tutorial/Classes), which is just a logical wrapper of variables and methods (functions) that operate on those variables. The methods our agent will have are the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Initialisation** (```__init__```):  Initialises the agent the first time it's created. \n",
        "* **policy**: The policy is a function that returns a *distribution* over the possible actions, given the current state.\n",
        "* **step**: This takes as input, the current state and previous reward from the environment, then uses the internal policy to determine which action to take. Specifically, it does some pre-processing of the state, then samples a single action from the distribution over possible actions obtained from the policy. \n",
        "* **reset**: This is called to reset the agent's variables before running it on a new episode\n",
        "* **end_episode**: This method signals to the agent that the current episode has come to an end. The agent may do some learning, or clean-up at the end of an episode. \n",
        "\n",
        "### The Random Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "To get a feel for an agent and the methods it has, we implement an agent that just takes a *random* action at every step. For demonstration purposes, we also calculate the **episode return** at the end of an episode. The episode return is the sum of the (discounted) rewards obtained during the episode. If the returns for episode $i$, with trajectory $\\tau_{i}$ are denoted $r_{i, t}$, and the **discount factor** is $\\gamma$, then the episode return is calcuated as: $r(\\tau_i) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T_i} \\gamma^t r_{i,t}$. The discount factor allows us to increase the importance of rewards received quickly and decrease the importance of rewards that take long to receive. It is especially important in environments that could have episodes that are infinitely long. In our particular environment where every episode is of the same length and the only non-zero reward is received at the end of the game, the discount factor doesn't make much difference and so we will ignore it (effectively set it to $1$) for the remainder of this practical.
