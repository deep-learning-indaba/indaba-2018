    "## The Agent\n",
    "We now turn to the agent. An agent receives the current state and (previous) reward from the environment, then uses an internal policy to determine an action to take. We implement an agent as a Python [**class**](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Beginner%27s_Python_Tutorial/Classes), which is just a logical wrapper of variables and methods (functions) that operate on those variables. The methods our agent will have are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initialisation** (```__init__```):  Initialises the agent the first time it's created. \n",
    "* **policy**: The policy is a function that returns a *distribution* over the possible actions, given the current state.\n",
    "* **step**: This takes as input, the current state and previous reward from the environment, then uses the internal policy to determine which action to take. Specifically, it does some pre-processing of the state, then samples a single action from the distribution over possible actions obtained from the policy. \n",
    "* **reset**: This is called to reset the agent's variables before running it on a new episode\n",
    "* **end_episode**: This method signals to the agent that the current episode has come to an end. The agent may do some learning, or clean-up at the end of an episode. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Random Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a feel for an agent and the methods it has, we implement an agent that just takes a *random* action at every step. For demonstration purposes, we also calculate the **episode return** at the end of an episode. The episode return is the sum of the (discounted) rewards obtained during the episode. If the returns for episode $i$, with trajectory $\\tau_{i}$ are denoted $r_{i, t}$, and the **discount factor** is $\\gamma$, then the episode return is calcuated as: $r(\\tau_i) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T_i} \\gamma^t r_{i,t}$. The discount factor allows us to increase the importance of rewards received quickly and decrease the importance of rewards that take long to receive. It is especially important in environments that could have episodes that are infinitely long. In our particular environment where every episode is of the same length and the only non-zero reward is received at the end of the game, the discount factor doesn't make much difference and so we will ignore it (effectively set it to $1$) for the remainder of this practical.

In this simple run-loop, the agent and environment run in lock-step. For each game frame, we get the state from the environment and pass it, along with the previous reward, to the agent. The agent selects an action that it wants to take given the game state. The action is taken in the environment and any reward received is recorded. We run the loop for multiple episodes, each time being careful to reset the game and agent (because they're starting a new game from scratch)."

    "## Your Tasks\n",
    "### Task 1: Learning Objectives [ALL]\n",
    "Review the learning objectives and ensure that you understand how the code in this practical relates to them. Ask your tutors if you don't understand anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Network Architecture [ALL]\n",
    "Experiment with different network architectures and parameters and see how this affects the performance of the agent. What do you notice? Do you think the algorithm is sensitive to the network parameters?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT**: Modify the code for the policy network in the ```__init__``` method of the ```FixedAgent``` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Seed Variance **[ALL]** \n",
    "Reveal and run the code in the cells below. This code will run the entire training procedure of the REINFORCE agent 10 times (using only 1000 episodes per run to save some time). It will then plot a chart that shows the mean of the rolling returns over the multiple runs along with an estimated *confidence interval* for the mean. You should notice that the confidence interval is fairly wide given that only the random seed is changing. This illustrates a problem with the REINFORCE algorithm: it has **high variance**. (It is however an **unbiased estimator** of the policy gradient!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4: Variance Reduction with a Basline **[INTERMEDIATE]** \n",
    "Read about value functions and how to approximate them using *Monte-Carlo* methods in [Slides 5 to 7 Here](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching_files/MC-TD.pdf). Then read slides [80, 84 and 85 here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2017/cs231n_2017_lecture14.pdf). The goal of this task is to use a simple value function $V(s)$ to implement **REINFORCE with a Baseline**, where the loss function per episode changes to: \n",

    "L(\\theta) &= -\\sum_{t=1}^{T_i} log(\\pi_\\theta(a_{i,t} | s_{i, t})) \\sum_{t=1}^{T_i} [r_{i,t} - V(s_{i, t})]\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, add code to the ```end_episode``` method of the ```ReinforceAgent``` class to estimate the value function. Subtract the value estimate for the state from the episode return at each step in the loop that computes the log_action_sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Re-run Task 3's code to plot the confidence interval around the mean episode returns to check what effect it has on the variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT**: You will need to *discretise* the state-space. We've provided a very crude function called ```state_to_buckets``` that you can use to do this, or implement your own! \n",

    "**Further Reading (Optional)**: See the section on how to introduce a baseline [here](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2017/03/28/going-deeper-into-reinforcement-learning-fundamentals-of-policy-gradients/) for more details about how and why this works!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Reading (Optional)**: This [blog post](https://flyyufelix.github.io/2017/10/12/dqn-vs-pg.html) contrasts policy gradient methods with an alternative value-based approach to RL called Deep Q-Networks. It also discusses some approaches to reducing the variance of the policy gradient estimator. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 5: Learning from pixels **[OPTIONAL]**\n",
    "The agent we implemented in this practical uses a simple numerical representation of the state of the environment. In many cases such a representation would not be available. Change the run-loop to instead pass the array of pixel values to the agent. (which you can get by calling ```environment.getScreenRGB()```). Change the agent's policy network to cater for this image-representation of the state. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 6: Other games **[OPTIONAL]**\n",
    "The PyGame Learning Environment (PLE) has [a number of games built-in](https://pygame-learning-environment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/games.html). Change the code in this practical to run on a different game and learn either from pixels or from the state representation provided by PLE. One interesting game you could try is FlappyBird! Remember to remove the reward overrides we set when trying a new game! "
