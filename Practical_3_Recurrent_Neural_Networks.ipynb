    "Feedforward models (eg deep MLPs and ConvNets) map fixed-size input-data (vectors of a fixed dimensionality) to their output labels. They're very powerful and have been successfully used for many tasks. However, a lot of data is not in the form of fixed-size vectors, but exists in the form of **sequences**. Language is one good example, where sentences are sequences of words. In some way, almost any data types can be considered as a sequence (for instance an image consists of a sequence of pixels, speech a sequence of phonemes, and so forth). \n",

After running the `rnn_forward()` function of our RNN defined above on $X$, we would have a list of internal states and outputs of the model at each sequence position. This process is called **unrolling in time**, because you can think of it as unrolling the *computations* defined by the RNN loop over the inputs at each position of the sequence.  RNNs are often used to model **time series data** (which we will do in this practical), and therefore these positions are referred to as **time-steps**, and hence we call this process \"unrolling over time\".\n",

    "RNNs model sequential data, and are designed to capture how ***outputs*** at the current time step are influenced by the ***inputs*** that came before them. This is referred to as **long-range dependencies**. At a high level, this allows the model to remember what it has seen so far in order to better contextualize what it is seeing at the moment (think about how knowing the context of the sentence or conversation can sometimes help one to better figure out the intended meaning of a misheard word or ambiguous statement). It is what makes these models so powerful, but it is also what makes them so hard to train!\n",
    "\n",
    "The most well-known algorithm for training RNNs is called **back-propagation through time (BPTT**; there are other algorithms). BPTT conceptually amounts to unrolling the computations of the RNN over time, computing the errors, and backpropagating the gradients through the unrolled graph structure.  Ideally we want to unroll the graph up to the maximum sequence length, however in practice, since sequence lengths vary and memory is limited, we only end up unrolling sequences up to some length $T$. This is called **truncated BPTT**, and is the most used variant of BPTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, there are two main issues when using (truncated) BPTT to train RNNs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Having shared (\"tied\") recurrent weights ($W_{hh}$) mean that **the gradient on these weights at some time step $t$ depends on all time steps up to time-step $T$**, the length of the full (truncated) sequence. This also leads to the **vanishing/exploding gradients** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory usage grows linearly with the total number of steps $T$ that we unroll for**, because we need to save/cache the activations at each time-step (look at the Python code above to convince yourself of this).  This matters computationally, since memory is a limited resource. It also matters statistically, because it puts a limit on the types of dependencies the model is exposed to, and hence that it could learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Think about that last statement and make sure you understand those 2 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "BPTT is very similar to the standard back-propagation algorithm. Key to understanding the BPTT algorithm is to realize that gradients on the non-recurrent weights (weights of a per time-step classifier that tries to predict the part-of-speech tag for each word for example) and recurrent weights (that transform $h_{t-1}$ into $h_t$) are computed differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The gradients of **non-recurrent weights** ($W_{hy}$) depend only on the error at that time-step, $E_t$.\n",
    "* The gradients of **recurrent weights** ($W_{hh}$) depend on all previous time-steps up to maximum length $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first point is fairly intuitive: predictions at time-step $t$ is related to the loss of that particular prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second point will be explained in more detail in the lectures (see also [this great blog post](http://www.wildml.com/2015/10/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-3-backpropagation-through-time-and-vanishing-gradients/)), but briefly, this can be summarized in these equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **current** state is a function of the **previous** state and the current input: $h_t = \\sigma(W_{hh}h_{t-1} + W_{xh}x_t)$\n",
    "2. The gradient of the loss $E_t$ at time $t$ on $W_{hh}$ is a function of the current hidden state and model predictions $\\hat{y}_t$ at time t: \n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial E_t}{\\partial W_{hh}} = \\frac{\\partial E_t}{\\partial \\hat{y}_t}\\frac{\\partial\\hat{y}_t}{\\partial h_t}\\frac{\\partial h_t}{\\partial W_{hh}}$\n",
    "3. Substituting (1) into (2) results in a **sum over all previous time-steps**:\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial E_t}{\\partial W_{hh}} = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{t} \\underbrace{\\frac{\\partial E_t}{\\partial \\hat{y}_t}\\frac{\\partial\\hat{y}_t}{\\partial h_t}\\frac{\\partial h_t}{\\partial h_k}\\frac{\\partial h_k}{\\partial W_{hh}}}_\\text{product of gradient terms}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this **repeated multiplicative interaction**, as the sequence length $t$ gets longer, the gradients themselves can get diminishingly small (**vanish**) or grow too large and result in numeric overflow (**explode**). This has been shown to be related to the norms of the recurrent weight matrices being less than or equal to 1. Intuitively, it works very similar to how multiplying a small number $v<1.0$ with itself repeatedly can quickly go to zero, or conversely, a large number $v>1.0$ could quickly go to infinity; only this is for matrices.\n"
